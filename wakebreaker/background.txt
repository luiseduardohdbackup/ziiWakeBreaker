I've been programming in C and C++ since I was in middle school and have never taken any kind of programming classes in school.  After dabbling in OpenGL for a while, I became involved with OpenGL ES development after recently entering www.gamedev.net's OpenGL ES contest.  Also, I was just employed a month ago at small development company, Silver Creek Entertainment, to port their current software to mobile platforms.
